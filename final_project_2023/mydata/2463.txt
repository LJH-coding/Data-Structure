Fermionic formulas for (1,p) logarithmic model characters in \Phi_{2,1}  quasiparticle realisation  We give expressions for the characters of $(1,p)$ logarithmic conformal field
models in the Gordon-type form. The formulas are obtained in terms of
``quasiparticles'' that are Virasoro $\Phi_{2,1}$ primary fields and generalize
the symplectic fermions.
