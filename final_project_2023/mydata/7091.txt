Minimal Surfaces in $S^3$ with Constant Contact Angle  We provide a characterization of the Clifford Torus in S3 via moving frames
and contact structure equations. More precisely, we prove that minimal surfaces
in S3 with constant contact angle must be the Clifford Torus. Some applications
of this result are then given, and some examples are discussed.
