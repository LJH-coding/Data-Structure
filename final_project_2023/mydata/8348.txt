Sensitivity of the neutron crystal diffraction experiment to the neutron  EDM and to the nuclear P-,T-violating forces  We establish a link between an angle of the neutron polarization rotation in
a crystal diffraction experiment and constants of the P-,T- violating
interactions. The consideration applies to the energy range of thermal and
resonance neutrons.
