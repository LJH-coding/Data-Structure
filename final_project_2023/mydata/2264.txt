Finite-size correction and bulk hole-excitations for special case of an  open XXZ chain with nondiagonal boundary terms at roots of unity  Using our solution for the open spin-1/2 XXZ quantum spin chain with N spins
and two arbitrary boundary parameters at roots of unity, the central charge and
the conformal dimensions for bulk hole excitations are derived from the 1/N
correction to the energy (Casimir energy).
