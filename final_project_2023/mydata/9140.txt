Neutrino oscillations in a variable-density medium and $\nu-$ bursts due  to the gravitational collapse of stars  Under certain conditions, the propagation of a beam of oscillating neutrinos
in a variable-density medium takes the form of an almost complete
transformation of the initial type of neutrino into another type. The depth of
oscillations is then negligible. The transformation can occur in the cores and
envelopes of collapsing stars.
