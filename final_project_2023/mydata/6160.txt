Gerby Localization, Z_3-Hodge Integrals and the GW Theory of C^3/Z_3  We exhibit a set of recursive relations that completely determine all
equivariant Gromov-Witten invariants of the quotient orbifold C^3/Z_3. We
interpret such invariants as G-Hodge Integrals, and produce relations among
them via Atiyah-Bott localization on moduli spaces of twisted stable maps to
gerbes over the projective line.
