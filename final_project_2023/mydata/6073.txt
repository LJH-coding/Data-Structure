Tensor Product of the Fundamental Representations for the Quantum Loop  Algebras of Type A at Roots of Unity  In this paper, we consider the necessary and sufficient conditions for the
tensor product of the fundamental representations for the restricted quantum
loop algebras of type A at roots of unity to be irreducible.
