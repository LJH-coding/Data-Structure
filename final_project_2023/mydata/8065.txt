Comment on "Removable singularities for solutions of coupled  Yang-Mills-Dirac equations" [J. Math. Phys. 47, 103502 (2006)]  A lemma from elliptic theory is used to improve a recent result by Li
concerning the removability of an isolated point singularity from solutions of
the coupled Yang-Mills-Dirac equations.
