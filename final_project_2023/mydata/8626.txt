Topological susceptibility in Yang-Mills theory in the vacuum correlator  method  We calculate the topological susceptibility of the Yang-Mills vacuum using
the field correlator method. Our estimate for the SU(3) gauge group, \chi^{1/4}
= 196(7) MeV, is in a very good agreement with the results of recent numerical
simulations of the Yang-Mills theory on the lattice.
