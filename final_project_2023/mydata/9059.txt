Electric-field control of tunneling magnetoresistance effect in a  Ni/InAs/Ni quantum-dot spin valve  We demonstrate an electric-field control of tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR)
effect in a semiconductor quantum-dot (QD) spin-valve device. By using
ferromagnetic Ni nano-gap electrodes, we observe the Coulomb blockade
oscillations at a small bias voltage. In the vicinity of the Coulomb blockade
peak, the TMR effect is significantly modulated and even its sign is switched
by changing the gate voltage, where the sign of the TMR value changes at the
resonant condition.
