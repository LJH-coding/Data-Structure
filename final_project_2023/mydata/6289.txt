On Uniqueness of Boundary Blow-up Solutions of a Class of Nonlinear  Elliptic Equations  We study boundary blow-up solutions of semilinear elliptic equations
$Lu=u_+^p$ with $p>1$, or $Lu=e^{au}$ with $a>0$, where $L$ is a second order
elliptic operator with measurable coefficients. Several uniqueness theorems and
an existence theorem are obtained.
