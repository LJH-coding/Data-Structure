The Generalized PT-Symmetric Sinh-Gordon Potential Solvable within  Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi Formalism  The generalized Sinh-Gordon potential is solved within quantum Hamiltonian
Jacobi approach in the framework of PT symmetry. The quasi exact solutions of
energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the generalized Sinh-Gordon potential
are found for n=0,1 states.
