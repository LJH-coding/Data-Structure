Method to measure neutron beam polarization with 2x1 Neutron Spin Filter  A method to measure a beam polarization with the use of polarized 3He gas is
discussed. It is shown that special design of the Neutron Spin Filter cell
allows for a fast and accurate measurement. The accuracy of this method is
analyzed.
