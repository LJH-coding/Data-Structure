PVLAS experiment, star cooling and BBN constraints: Possible  interpretation with temperature dependent gauge symmetry breaking  It is known that the kinetic mixing of photon and another U(1)_ex gauge boson
can introduce millicharged particles. Millicharged particles $f$ of mass 0.1 eV
can explain the PVLAS experiment. We suggest a temperature dependent gauge
symmetry breaking of U(1)_ex for this idea to be consistent with astrophysical
and cosmological constraints.
