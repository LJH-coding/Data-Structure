Necessary and sufficient conditions for solvability of the  Hartman-Wintner problem for difference equations  For homogeneous difference equation of the second order we study the analogy
of Hartman-Wintner problem on asymptotic integration of fundamental system of
solutions as argument tends to infinity.
