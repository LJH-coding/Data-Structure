Model independent Breit-Wigner parameters of nucleon resonances  S11(1535), S11(1650) and P11(1710)  Estimates of Breit-Wigner parameters of nucleon resonances were obtained by
phenomenological analysis of eta meson photoproduction on protons performed
completely by statistical procedures without appealing to theoretical models
