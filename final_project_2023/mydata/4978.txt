Some remarks on sinc integrals and their connection with combinatorics,  geometry and probability  We give an alternative, combinatorial/geometrical evaluation of a class of
improper sinc integrals studied by the Borweins. A probabilistic interpretation
is also noted and used to shed light on a related combinatorial identity.
