Sinc Approximation of the Heat Distribution on the Boundary of a  Two-Dimensional Finite Slab  We consider the two-dimensional problem of recovering globally in time the
heat distribution on the surface of a layer inside of a heat conducting body
from two interior temperature measurements. The problem is ill-posed. The
approximation function is represented by a two-dimensional Sinc series and the
error estimate is given.
