Existence of Infinitely Many Solutions for a Quasilinear Elliptic  Problem on Time Scales  We study a boundary-value quasilinear elliptic problem on a generic time
scale. Making use of the fixed-point index theory, sufficient conditions are
given to obtain existence, multiplicity, and infinite solvability of positive
solutions.
