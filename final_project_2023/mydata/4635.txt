Numerical study of liquid metal flow in a rectangular duct under the  influence of a heterogenous magnetic field  The paper presents 3D numerical results for the laminar liquid metal flow in
a rectangular duct compared with experimental results. It is shown that the
magnetic interaction parameter $N$ is the main parameter governing the flow
provided turbulent pulsations are locally suppressed by magnetic field.
