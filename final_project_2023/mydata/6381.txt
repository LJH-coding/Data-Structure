The integrals in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik. Part 5: Some trigonometric  integrals  We present evalauations and provide proofs of definite integrals involving
the function x^p cos^n x. These formulae are generalizations of 3.761.11 and
3.822.1, among others, in the classical table of integrals by I. S. Gradshteyn
and I. M. Ryzhik.
