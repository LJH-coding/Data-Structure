Gauge invariances vis-{\'a}-vis Diffeomorphisms in second order metric  gravity: A new Hamiltonian approach  A new analysis of the gauge invariances and their unity with diffeomorphism
invariances in second order metric gravity is presented which strictly follows
Dirac's constrained Hamiltonian approach.
