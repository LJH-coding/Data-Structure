Uniqueness of reconstruction and an inversion procedure for  thermoacoustic and photoacoustic tomography  The paper contains a simple approach to reconstruction in Thermoacoustic and
Photoacoustic Tomography. The technique works for any geometry of point
detectors placement and for variable sound speed satisfying a non-trapping
condition. A uniqueness of reconstruction result is also obtained.
