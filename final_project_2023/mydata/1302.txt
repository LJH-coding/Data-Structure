General Doppler Shift Equation and the Possibility of Systematic Error  in Calculation of Z for High Redshift Type Ia Supernovae  Systematic error in calculation of z for high redshift type Ia supernovae
could help explain unexpected luminosity values that indicate an accelerating
rate of expansion of the universe.
