On factorizations of smooth nonnegative matrix-values functions and on  smooth functions with values in polyhedra  We discuss the possibility to represent smooth nonnegative matrix-valued
functions as finite linear combinations of fixed matrices with positive
real-valued coefficients whose square roots are Lipschitz continuous. This
issue is reduced to a similar problem for smooth functions with values in a
polyhedron.
