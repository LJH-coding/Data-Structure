On the decay properties of solutions to a class of Schr\"odinger  equations  We construct a local in time, exponentially decaying solution of the
one-dimensional variable coefficient Schrodinger equation by solving a
nonstandard boundary value problem. A main ingredient in the proof is a new
commutator estimate involving the projections P+ and P- onto the positive and
negative frequencies.
