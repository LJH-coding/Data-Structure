Analytical results for 2-D non-rectilinear waveguides based on the  Green's function  We consider the problem of wave propagation for a 2-D rectilinear optical
waveguide which presents some perturbation. We construct a mathematical
framework to study such a problem and prove the existence of a solution for the
case of small imperfections. Our results are based on the knowledge of a
Green's function for the rectilinear case.
