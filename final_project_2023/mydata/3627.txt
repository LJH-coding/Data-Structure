A nearly optimal discrete query quantum algorithm for evaluating NAND  formulas  We present an O(\sqrt{N}) discrete query quantum algorithm for evaluating
balanced binary NAND formulas and an O(N^{{1/2}+O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\log N}})})
discrete query quantum algorithm for evaluating arbitrary binary NAND formulas.
