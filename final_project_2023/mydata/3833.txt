Observations of Comet C/LINEAR (2004B1) between2 and 3 AU heliocentric  distance  We present R-band observations of comet C2004B1 obtained in the period June,
21 - August 20, 2006. The data have been reduced to surface brightness maps,
light curves, and mean radial profiles of the coma. In two cases a decrease of
the brightness was recorded, which lasted for several days. The brightness
decrease was accompanied by morphological changes in the coma.
