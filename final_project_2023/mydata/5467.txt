Entanglement Assisted Classical Capacity of a Class of Quantum Channels  with Long-Term Memory  In this paper we evaluate the entanglement assisted classical capacity of a
class of quantum channels with long-term memory, which are convex combinations
of memoryless channels. The memory of such channels can be considered to be
given by a Markov chain which is aperiodic but not irreducible.
