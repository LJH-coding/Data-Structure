Reducing phase error in long numerical binary black hole evolutions with  sixth order finite differencing  We describe a modification of a fourth-order accurate ``moving puncture''
evolution code, where by replacing spatial fourth-order accurate differencing
operators in the bulk of the grid by a specific choice of sixth-order accurate
stencils we gain significant improvements in accuracy. We illustrate the
performance of the modified algorithm with an equal-mass simulation covering
nine orbits.
