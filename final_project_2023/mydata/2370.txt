Molecular Dynamics Study of a Thermal Expansion Coefficient: Ti Bulk  with an Elastic Minimum Image Method  Linear thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) and specific heat of Ti bulk is
investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulation. Elastic Minimum Image
Convention of periodic boundary conditions is introduced to allow the bulk to
adjust its size according to the new temporarily fixed temperature. The TEC and
the specific heat of Ti are compared to the available theoretical and
experimental data.
