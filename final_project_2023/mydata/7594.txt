A solution of a problem of Sophus Lie: Normal forms of 2-dim metrics  admitting two projective vector fields  We give a complete list of normal forms for the 2-dimensional metrics that
admit a transitive Lie pseudogroup of geodesic-preserving transformations and
we show that these normal forms are mutually non-isometric. This solves a
problem posed by Sophus Lie.
