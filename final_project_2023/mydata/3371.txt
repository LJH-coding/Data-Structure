Shearfree perfect fluids with solenoidal magnetic curvature and a  gamma-law equation of state  We show that shearfree perfect fluids obeying an equation of state p=(gamma
-1) mu are non-rotating or non-expanding under the assumption that the spatial
divergence of the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor is zero.
