Observation of room-temperature ferroelectricity in tetragonal strontium  titanate thin films on SrTiO3 (001) substrates  We investigated the ferroelectric properties of strontium titanate (STO) thin
films deposited on SrTiO3 (001) substrate with SrRuO3 electrodes. The STO layer
was grown coherently on the SrTiO3 substrate without in-plane lattice
relaxation, but its out-of-plane lattice constant increased with a decrease in
the oxygen pressure during deposition. Using piezoresponse force microscopy and
P-V measurements, we showed that our tetragonal STO films possess
room-temperature ferroelectricity. We discuss the possible origins of the
observed ferroelectricity.
